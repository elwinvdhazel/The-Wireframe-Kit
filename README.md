# :fire: Stretch wireframe kit :fire:
*The only lightweight toolkit you need to create topnotch wireframes for your awesome app en web projects*

## 🛠 Resources
In this Wireframe kit we make use of some external resources:

### Fonts
In this Wireframe kit we make use of the official Apple SF Pro Typeface (Regular & Bold) and the Fira mono font.
Download & install the fonts first before you start working with this kit:
- :package: Download [Apple San Francisco Pro](https://developer.apple.com/fonts/)
- :package: Download [Fira mono](https://mozilla.github.io/Fira/)

### Icons
For the icons, we make use of a Material design icon-set. You can download the latest version here:
- :package: Download the (unofficial) [Material icon-set](https://www.sketchappsources.com/free-source/3022-material-icons-sketch-library-with-color-overrides.html)

*To use this icon-set, download the file and add this file as a library (open file, File > Add as library…).*
*It is possible, of course, to use other icon libraries. As long as the icons are 24*24px in size.*

### Symbols
This kit includes all the basic symbols you’ll need for your project.
With this set of symbols, you can create endless variations and combinations to build your interface. 

#### Missing something? 
Something needed that’s not in the kit?
Be creative and see if you can make something new by combining existing symbols.

If that’s not working out, create a pull request.

### Metrics
To keep the wireframes consistent, we make use of the binary number system for the size, spacing and aligning of elements.

*Pro tip: In sketch, use the “alt” key + mouse hovering to check the distance between elements*

### Prototype 
If you have a recent version of Sketch (> 49) you can make use of the prototype feature of sketch. :muscle:

## All set!
Now go and create some awesome wireframes! :ok_hand:
